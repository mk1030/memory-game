## Overview

The Memory Game Project is a game created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.  

The game can be played by clicking on a card and then clicking on another card to find a matching pair of icons.  

Anytime, during the game you can reset the game and start over. The number of stars change throughout the game, depending on the amount of moves you make. 1 move = clicking on two cards.  

The game also keeps a track of your time. Once you successfully match all the cards, you will be able to see your game stats such as the time it took you to complete the game, the number of stars, and the number of moves! 

Good Luck!!
